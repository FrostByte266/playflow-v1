# Playflow
## By William Grigor
### Completed as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp

## Live Site: https://playflow.herokuapp.com/login

## Technologies:
* SvelteKit
* Express
* MongoDB
* TypeScript
* PostCSS
* PNPM
* Heroku

## Future Goals
The app is really poorly deployed, heroku didn't work as I was thinking it would, lead to a really messy deployment.
There are also some unsolved bugs, such as the screen blanking out when signing in, but a reload fixes it.
There were also a lot of features that were cut from the MVP because of time constraints.

## User Stories

* As an employee, I want to be able to login using a PIN or my play pass
* As an employee, I want to be able to complete the AM and PM card taps (equipment evals) and track my progress to ensure I get them all
* As a manager, I want to be able to manage my employee logins so all employees can login
* As a technician, I want to be able to alter the status of issues so I can keep track of what needs work
* As a technician, I want to be able to see all my issues in one clear, concise view, so I can organize my day
* As a manager, I want the card tap times to be tracked and provide clear targets to hold employees accountable
